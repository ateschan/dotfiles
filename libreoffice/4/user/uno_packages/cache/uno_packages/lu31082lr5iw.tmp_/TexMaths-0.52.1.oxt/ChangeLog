- Equation attributes are now stored into the image title and description instead of the UserDefinedAttributes property. This allows equation images to be pasted as Draw images instead of GDI images, and fixes the bug that prevented to edit Writer equations pasted to Draw or Impress. As a side effect, the poor SVG rendering quality that was only visible in Impress and Draw (in LibreOffice 3.5.x and 3.6.x) is now also visible in Writer.

The internal graphic format used for transparent PNG images is now SVXB (Starview Bitmap/Animation, code 12) for Linux and Mac OS, and GDI (code 3) for Windows, because the bitmap format does not allow a transparent background
- Add spanish translation (thanks to Luis Jaime Salazar Ramirez)
- Restored the Word compatibility option for vertical alignment. Equations are now verticaly centered when Word compatibility is requested, otherwise they are aligned to base line. Numbered equations are always vertically centered

- Reorganized the About dialog to present things like in the Sysconfig dialog
- The position and size of the TexMaths Equation window is now automatically saved
- Fix some typos in the french translation
- Set equation numbers as (Chapter.Number) when there are chapters in the document
- Add an option to the System Config dialog to select the text displayed before numbered equations

0.31
- Fix the wrong equation generation on Linux systems. This was due to /bin/sh pointing to the dash shell and not on the bash shell. Strangely, the shell script used to generate equations doesn't work with the dash shell, but I don't know why! So I replaced /bin/sh with /bin/bash and everything is OK now. However, this means that TexMaths will not work if bash is not installed...
- Fix the makepkg script : this script only works with bash

0.30
- Add partial Danish translation (thanks to Leif Lodahl)
- Redesign of the System Config dialog. The new dialog has tabs and is smaller

0.29
- Fix a bug that made TexMaths not work under LibreOffice 3.3.3 (space character after &_)

0.28
- Add a "PNG compatibility with Word 2000" option on non Windows systems. This is because equations look nicer on Libreoffice when this option is not used. So the user who doesn't care about Word 2000 would benefit from disabling this option
- Add two options to allow inserting a paragraph break before or after a numbered equation
- Fallback to english locale when the help and description files are not available in the current locale

0.27
- Since equations can be produced separately by dvipng alone or dvisvgm alone, these two external programs are now made optional. Only one of them is required. This allows TexMaths to work even if the user doesn't have installed one of these programs
- Improved the SysConfig dialog
- Fix the paths in the batch script for Windows
- Add "..." to some menu button names
- Changed the name of the SysConfigDialog() function in the About module to AboutDialog()
- Fix the second radio button in the Preferences dialog that did not function properly (activation sequence number problem)
- Fix a problem in LaTeX mode, where the GetVertShift() function is called and the tmpfile.bsl does not exist

- In Writer, move one character right of the equation, to be able to type text just after

0.26
- Add a macro and a toolbar button to write numbered equations in Writer
- Add a shortcut for that macro
- Add an icon and renamed other icons

0.25
- On Windows the tricky process used to generate a PNg image (for maximum MS Word compatibility) doesn't work reliably and I didn't find why. So I fall back to the simple paste process on this system

0.24
- Add an help button to the main dialog, reorganized directories and renamed some files
- Add 72, 96, and 120 dpi predefined values and fixed a bug in the dpi selector control
- Fix an execution error that occurred when the image point size is 0
- Fix the way Prefrences are handled. Now the strategy is the following : In Preferences dialog, display the config file preferences if they exist, otherwise display the default preferences. If the save button is clicked, set the TexMaths Equations preferences to the values of the config file
- Display a syntax error message when the generated equation image has size 0

0.23
- The clipboard content is not lost anymore when exiting TexMaths. We save the clipboard when entering TexMaths and then we restore it before exiting
- Set the keyboard shortcut for generating LaTeX equations as Alt-L or Ctrl-L  

0.22
- In Writer, changed the way images are generated to ensure maximum compatibility with MS Word 2000 or 2003. This is not perfect but works better now. For PNG images, we use a special paste with bitmap format and for SVG images we use a simple paste. 
- Rename icons

0.21
- Fix the problem of equations inserted within a paragraph (not at the start or not at the end) that were not correctly placed

0.15
- Add configuration options for Draw documents
- Document type is now guessed using the GetDocumentType() function from Andrew Pytoniak

- Add a ConfigSaved property to the registry. This is used to know if the configuration was already saved when starting the program
- Remove the Reset button from the configuration dialog

0.13
- The script name is now based on the TexMaths version number. This allows to force the creation of a new script whenever the version changes 

0.12
- Use LaTeX code to generate the depth information for baseline alignment of inline and inline display equations. We use a trick from Maarten Sneep, see http://mactextoolbox.sourceforge.net/articles/baseline.html. Thus, the use of preview.sty is no more necessary and color can be used in equations. It also no more necessary to generate a png image to get the depth information with SVG format
- The script is now located in the user directory (sUserPath) 
- The reset button now completely resets the configuration and deletes rc, prb, script and system log file
- Fix the PNG image size in the temporary Draw document
- Fix vertical alignment with text equations

0.9
- Fix compatibility issues with MS Word (inline equations were badly positioned and image object was duplicated when exported to Word) 
- Position the equation at the center of the visible area in Impress and Draw

0.8
- On Windows, the script is now located in %HOMEDRIVE%\texmaths-%USERNAME%\TexMaths.bat where all space characters are removed from the original %USERNAME% string. The directory is made hidden. In multiuser environment, this allows to install and uninstall the extension without permission problems.

0.7
- Let it work under Windows. Due to a bug in the Shell() command (script paths with spaces don't work) the TexMaths.bat script is located in C:\. This is bad of course, but I didn't manage yet to do something better.

0.6
- Remove the transparent and cropping options because they are not used anymore
- PNG resolution is now set using a combo box
- Font size are now set using a combo box

- Now PNG images are generated using dvipng
- Fix the wrong PNG image size by estimating the real screen resolution
- Fix the wrong position of images using the baseline computed by dvipng using the --depth option

0.4
- Fix the wrong size of SVG equations. This was because when importing the SVG equations, it is splitted in many different shapes and then we imported only the first shape. This is solved by combining all the shapes before copying into the clipboard

0.3
- Code cleanup
- Add "Option Explicit" to force declaration of variables. Fix all missing declarations
- Fix some typos in the original code

0.2
- Fix declarations like Dim var1, var2 as String, which should be (according to the documentation) Dim var1 as String, var2 as String
- Replace each occurrence of StarDesktop.CurrentComponent with ThisComponent. This allows to run TexMaths within the IDE

0.1
- First version built from OOoLatex 4.0.0 beta 2
- Remove the expand dialog because TexMaths is intended to produce equations as pure graphics image (no need for specific Latex fonts to see the produced equations in LibreOffice, OpenOffice or MS Office)
