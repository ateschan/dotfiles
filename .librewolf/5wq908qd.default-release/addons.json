Knowing where you're connected to adds an extra layer of awareness to your browsing and can be useful to indicate the native languages and legal jurisdictions that may apply. Additional information can be obtained via a multitude of external lookups and users can add their own custom actions. All actions can be added to the flag icon's context menu and set to icon click or keyboard shortcuts for quick access.\n\nClicking the flag icon loads our default action, Geotool, which gives a detailed map showing the city the server is in and other useful information such as its local time and ISP. Many other actions are available for a wide range of uses such as:\n\n    Site safety and malware checks\n    Finding similar sites and reviews\n    Automatic translation to your language\n    SEO and web development research\n    Diagnostics like pings and traceroutes\n    Whois and DNS information\n    Page code validation\n    Quick URL shortening\n    Copying a server's IP address or other info\n    or you can create your own custom actions!\n\nFlagfox is simple, unobtrusive, and uses relatively little resources. In order to protect your privacy, country lookups are done locally rather than asking an external server about every page you browse to. It works by accessing an internal IP address location database, basically a rough map of the physical layout of the Internet, based on data provided by Maxmind. This gives a flag for the nationality of the actual location of the server you're connected to, rather than just the nationality of the domain name which may be different. Flagfox updates are provided on a monthly basis to keep this internal database accurate.","weeklyDownloads":2132,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Dave G","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/235431/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/128/128264.png?modified=1622132177","width":331,"height":342,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/128/128264.jpg?modified=1622132177","thumbnailWidth":331,"thumbnailHeight":342,"caption":"Flagfox shows a flag icon in the location bar indicating the physical location of the current website's server.

and seamless privacy protection for your browser: tracker blocking, cookie protection, DuckDuckGo private search, email protection, HTTPS upgrading, and much more.","fullDescription":"Privacy, simplified.\n\nProtecting your privacy online is like protecting your home. Locking the front door won’t stop the most determined folks from getting inside, especially if you’ve left the back door and windows unlocked and an extra key under the doormat. That’s why we offer multiple types of privacy protection, most of which aren’t offered in most popular browsers by default.\n\nWith the press of a button, you get seamless protection from most 3rd-party trackers while you search and browse, access to tracking protections for emails you receive, and much more. Together these privacy essentials make more privacy your default.\n\nFEATURE HIGHLIGHTS\n\n    Search Privately by Default — DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search the web without being tracked.\n    Escape Website Trackers Before They Load — automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using (e.g. sale, ads, etc.) any data from these trackers. Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology – called 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection – goes well above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default.\n    Automatically Enforce Encryption — force many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider. Most popular browsers only direct users to encrypted versions of pages in specific circumstances, like when you navigate directly to a page in the address bar. We check our list of upgradable sites for all links you click.\n    Enable Built-in Email Protection — Over 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses contained trackers that can detect when you’ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers.\n    Escape Fingerprinting — help stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your browser and device settings.\n    Block Tracking Cookies— prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.\n\n\nADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS NOT AVAILABLE ON MOST BROWSERS\n\n    Link Tracking Protection — helps stop companies from gathering your browsing history and other information via personal identifiers embedded in the links you click on.\n    Embedded Social Content Tracking Protection — blocks embedded Facebook content around the web so they can't track you through their videos, posts, and comments found on other sites. You can easily unblock to view them if desired.\n    Google AMP Protection — forces sites to load content directly from publishers instead of using Google-owned links, which are full of creepy trackers.\n    Signal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC) — built-into our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n\n\nNote about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.\n\nRead more about this and our Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/web-tracking-protections/\n\nYou don't need to wait to take back your privacy. Join the millions of people using DuckDuckGo and protect many of your everyday online activities with one app. It's privacy, simplified.\n\nAbout Us: https://duckduckgo.com/about/\nHow It Works: https://duckduckgo.com/app\nPrivacy Newsletter: https://duckduckgo.com/newsletter\nPrivacy Policy: https://duckduckgo.com/privacy/\nTerms of Service: https://duckduckgo.com/terms/\nOpen Source: https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension","weeklyDownloads":6390,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"DuckDuckGo","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/3946396/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/307/307022.png?modified=1729109449","width":2400,"height":1500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/307/307022.jpg?modified=1729109449","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/307/307023.png?modified=1729109449","width":2400,"height":1500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/307/307023.jpg?modified=1729109449","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/307/307025.png?modified=1729109449","width":2400,"height":1500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/307/307025.jpg?modified=1729109449","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/307/307024.png?modified=1729109449","width":2400,"height":1500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/307/307024.jpg?modified=1729109449","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/307/307026.png?modified=1729109449","width":2400,"height":1500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/307/307026.jpg?modified=1729109449","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.3421,"reviewCount":639,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/reviews/","updateDate":1722322993000}]}
